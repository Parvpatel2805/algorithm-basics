# Algorithm: Bucket Sort
# Type: Sorting, Non-comparison based
# Time Complexity: O(n + k) average, where k is number of buckets
# Space Complexity: O(n + k)

function bucketSort(arr, bucketCount):
    create buckets = array of empty lists of size bucketCount

    for each element in arr:
        index = floor(element * bucketCount / maxValue)
        buckets[index].append(element)

    for each bucket in buckets:
        sort(bucket)  # usually insertion sort

    return concatenation of all buckets
